This project is my take on a crypto-currency exchange site, made with React.
Current functionality is:
A brief overview of the first 100 coins by popularity, and also a page for viewing detailed information, for each coin, in comparison with a currency or a cryptocurrency,
displayed in a chart, and currently it displays the fluctuations only for the last 24 hours.

It uses CoinGecko API, which isn't that accurate but it will do for a sample project.
For the charts I had used ChartJS, and the project is styled with Chakra-UI.
